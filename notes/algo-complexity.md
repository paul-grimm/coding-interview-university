# Algorithm Complexity

## Big-O

How well does an algorithm scale as the amount of data increases such as given and array of 10 vs an array of 10000

O(1)
order of one

executes the same amount of time regardless of number of scale of data set

O(n)
order of n

algo time to complete grows in direct proportion to the data
takes longer as more data is included

O(n^2)
order of n squared

example is bubble sort
nested iterations
**this one is not ideal or something to strive for because it's inefficient**

O(log n)
order of log n

data being used is being decreased by roughly 50% each iteration
**this one is good because it's efficient**

O(n log n)
order of n log n
